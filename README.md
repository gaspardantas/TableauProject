The heatmap revealed varying patterns of citation issuance for different offense classifications over time. Notable insights include an increase in DUI citations in certain years and fluctuations in citations for reckless driving and vehicular manslaughter offenses.
- **Total Citations Over the Years:** A heatmap was created to depict the total number of criminal traffic citations issued each year. Analysis of the heatmap indicated fluctuations in total citation counts over the years, with some years experiencing higher volumes of citations compared to others. Trends such as a gradual increase or decrease in total citations over time were observed, highlighting potential changes in enforcement practices or societal factors influencing citation rates.
- **Breakdown of Agencies Who Applied the Citations Over the Years:** A heatmap was generated to illustrate the distribution of citations among different law enforcement agencies or jurisdictions over the years.  Analysis of the heatmap revealed varying levels of citation issuance among different agencies, with some agencies consistently issuing a higher number of citations compared to others.  Trends in agency-specific citation rates were identified, with certain agencies exhibiting changes in citation issuance patterns over the analyzed period.
- **Additional Analysis:** Correlation analysis was conducted to explore relationships between offense classifications and total citation counts over time, revealing which offense types contributed most to variations in total citation volumes.  Trend analysis was performed to identify significant changes or patterns in citation issuance rates over the analyzed period, providing further insights into temporal trends and enforcement practices.

This EDA provided valuable insights into the distribution, trends, and patterns of criminal traffic citations in Florida from 2011 to 2023. The analysis revealed fluctuations in citation issuance rates across offense classifications, variations in total citation counts over the years, and agency-specific citation trends. These insights can inform decision-making processes, resource allocation strategies, and targeted interventions aimed at improving road safety and traffic enforcement efforts in the state.
## Results and Findings

- **Overall Decrease in Traffic Criminal Violations:** The analysis revealed a significant decrease of almost 30% in traffic criminal violations from 2011 to 2023 in Florida. This indicates positive progress in road safety practices and compliance with traffic laws over the analyzed period.
